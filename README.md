# DSA_CODE

This repository contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice questions from GeeksforGeeks (GFG). The solutions are written in Java.

## Overview

GeeksforGeeks is a well-known platform for learning and practicing DSA concepts through coding problems. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to the problems I've solved on GFG.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **Easy**
  - [Problem 1](Easy/Problem_1)
  - [Problem 2](Easy/Problem_2)
  - ...
  
- **Medium**
  - [Problem 1](Medium/Problem_1)
  - [Problem 2](Medium/Problem_2)
  - ...
  
- **Hard**
  - [Problem 1](Hard/Problem_1)
  - [Problem 2](Hard/Problem_2)
  - ...

Each problem directory contains a `Solution.java` file with the solution code and a `Problem_Description.md` file with the problem statement.
