# DSA_CODE

This repository contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice questions from GeeksforGeeks (GFG). The solutions are written in Java.

## Overview

GeeksforGeeks is a well-known platform for learning and practicing DSA concepts through coding problems. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to the problems I've solved on GFG.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

├── Problem_1
│ ├── Solution.java
│ └── Problem_Description.md
├── Problem_2
│ ├── Solution.java
│ └── Problem_Description.md
└── ...

- Each problem has its own directory.
- Inside each problem directory, there is a `Solution.java` file containing the Java code for solving the problem.
- Additionally, there is a `Problem_Description.md` file providing the problem statement and any additional details.

## Getting Started

To use this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA_CODE.git


2. Navigate to the directory of the problem you're interested in.
3. Open the `Solution.java` file to view the code solution.
4. Read the `Problem_Description.md` file for the problem statement.

Feel free to explore and learn from the solutions provided!

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have a better solution to any of the problems or you've solved a new problem from GFG, feel free to submit a pull request.
